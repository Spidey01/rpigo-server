RPIGO -- Raspberry Pi Goofing Off.
==================================

The whole purpose of this is a nice little package to kee my Raspberry Pi from Goofing Off. Gotta make it work hard, ya know?

In this repository you'll find the server side expected to run on the rpi itself. It isn't very tightly bound to the rpi, in fact it will generally work fine on a regular Debian x86 machine.

For the Android companion app, see [this repository](https://github.com/Spidey01/rpigo-client).
